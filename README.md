Codes for 8-bit AVR microcontrollers written in assembly and C language.  
I have divided these into two separate categories:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Early Files: contains codes which I wrote when I had just started exploring the world of microcontrollers. Most of the codes I wrote at that time are lost because I did no version control back then. I reused using "Ctrl + A" and "Delete" the same .asm .c file again and again because it was easier to rewrite it than change .bat scripts or makefiles again and again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Rest of the folders contains proper project files. They all are used to accomplish a single purpose and aren't in a messy state like those in Early Files. For example: using the code given in segiot, a person can connect a 4 digit seven segment display to an Arduino Nano and display "IoT".
